COM_JINBOUND_LEAD_MANAGER_RANDOM_ADVICE_1="<strong>TIP</strong>: Each nurturing email should relate to the others in the campaign. They do not have to be identical, but make sure you have a purpose with each email and it makes sense. For example, you wouldn’t want to have one email in your campaign about how to prepare a turkey and then the other email about being a vegetarian."
COM_JINBOUND_LEAD_MANAGER_RANDOM_ADVICE_2="<strong>TIP</strong>: Lead nurturing is all about creating relationships with your leads. You want to make sure you are targeting the right people with the right things. You are trying to move your leads down the funnel and you can’t do that without offering great content that fits their needs and current place in the funnel.<br />This means you will need to create offers for each section of the funnel. It is also worth creating separate persona offers within each section of the funnel so you can individualize different personas' needs."
COM_JINBOUND_LEAD_MANAGER_RANDOM_ADVICE_3="<strong>TIP</strong>: Carefully plan when each email will be sent. You don’t want to send 5 emails in one week. Space out the emails over a month or two span, depending on how many emails you have to send. If the service/product is further down the sales funnel, you want to make sure you give the reader more attention and emails because they have already invested an interest and you don’t want to lose them."
COM_JINBOUND_LEAD_MANAGER_RANDOM_ADVICE_4="<strong>TIP</strong>: Keep an eye on the click through rate, or the percentage of people that click on your email, as well as the unsubscribe rate. If you don't have an unsubscribe rate under 5%, you should go back and take a look at your emails within that campaign. You can easily test what works and doesn't work by changing certain subject lines and images."
COM_JINBOUND_LEAD_MANAGER_RANDOM_ADVICE_5="<strong>TIP</strong>: Make sure to add some voice within your emails. You want to create a brand identity and be personable with your subscribers. By sending a generic email, you are not helping create a recognizable brand personality. Have fun with it and let your voice shine through. It will not only make writing emails easier for you, it will also make the emails enjoyable to read for viewers."
