If your site breaks after upgrading to different version family of Joomla! <strong>DO NOT</strong> ask for our support.

Let's make this crystal clear: if you upgrade to a different Joomla! version family and your site breaks you are on your own. Nobody can help you. Your one and only way to have a working site is restoring from a backup. Always take a backup of your site (and test it!) before updating it to a different Joomla! version family.

If you are not aware of this yet, both Super Administrators and regular Administrators have access to it. Given the fact that the extensions installer can be used to insert executable code and run database SQL commands on your site, it can be exploited for insider attacks."
ATOOLS_LBL_WAF_OPT_NONEWADMINS_TIP="When enabled, trying to modify the settings of an existing or create a new a Manager, Administrator or Super Administrator will fail."
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_WAF_OPT_RESETJOOMLATFA_TIP="When enabled, Admin Tools will disable the Joomla! Two Factor Authentication configuration for a user when they are resetting their password. This only applies to the built-in Joomla! 3.2 and later Two Factor Authentication feature, not the Two Factor Authentication feature of Admin Tools."
ATOOLS_LBL_WAF_OPT_NOFESALOGIN_TIP="When enabled, it will not be possible for Super Administrators to log in to your site's front-end. This is a security precaution against password brute forcing. Even users with Super User privileges will not be able to log the front-end of your site."
ATOOLS_LBL_WAF_OPT_TRACKFAILEDLOGINS_TIP="When enabled, failed login attempts of any kind of user (even simple registered users) count as security exceptions and are being logged in Admin Tools' Security Exceptions Log. There is a very useful implication to that. Since they count as security exceptions, they count towards the exceptions limit you set up in the automatic IP blocking. Therefore, after a number of failed login attempts, the user's IP will be automatically blocked for the duration you have set up."
ATOOLS_LBL_WAF_OPT_DEACTIVATEUSERS_TIP="Admin Tools can optionally deactivate existing user accounts when there are multiple failed attempts to log in using their username, protecting user accounts from brute force attacks. In here you can specify the number of failed logins and the time period these have to occur before the user is deactivated, e.g. 3 failed logins in 1 minute."
ATOOLS_LBL_WAF_OPT_CUSTGENERATOR_TIP="All Joomla! installations set the meta generator tag, a piece of HTML in the header of all pages, to advertise the fact that your site is running on Joomla!. This information is cached by search engines and is exploited by attackers to deduce that your site is running Joomla! when looking for potential targets. Enabling this option allows you to set a custom value for the generator tag in the next option. Be inventive!"
ATOOLS_LBL_WAF_OPT_TMPL_TIP="One of the lesser known Joomla! features are its system templates. Whenever an error occurs or you put your site offline, Joomla! loads the respective system template. Passing the name of the template in the URL by appending, say, ?tmpl=offline allows you to test those templates without having to actually produce an error or put your site off-line. Enabling this option will turn off this hidden Joomla! feature. Do note that tmpl=system and tmpl=component must be permitted (see next option), as they are required by some extensions to work."
ATOOLS_LBL_WAF_OPT_TEMPLATE_TIP="Another Joomla! hidden feature is the ability to switch between installed templates by passing a special URL parameter. For instance, if you want to apply the Beez5 template, just pass the parameter <code>?template=beez5</code>"
ATOOLS_LBL_WAF_OPT_ALLOWSITETEMPLATE_TIP="Enabling this option partially overrides the previous option (the blocking of template=foo in the URL). If the template= URL query parameter specifies the name of a template which exists in your template directory, then it will be allowed without raising a security exception. This is required only on sites which are using more than one template at the same time."
ATOOLS_LBL_WAF_OPT_HTTPBLENABLE_TIP="Enables the integration with <a href='http://www.projecthoneypot.org'>Project Honeypot</a>. <strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: You need to register to Project Honeypot, get a key and enter it in the next option for this feature to work."
ATOOLS_LBL_WAF_OPT_BBHTTPBLKEY_TIP="Enter your HTTP:BL key. You can sign up for Project Honeypot and get your key at <a href='http://www.projecthoneypot.org/httpbl_configure.php'>http://www.projecthoneypot.org/httpbl_configure.php</a>."
ATOOLS_LBL_WAF_OPT_HTTPBLTHRESHOLD_TIP="Project Honeypot uses a logarithmic "_QQ_"threat rating"_QQ_" to rank the possibility of a specific IP being a spammer. This options defines the minimum threat level an IP must have before it's blocked. A value of 25 means that this IP has submitted 100 spam messages on Project Honeypot's spam catching honeypots and is usually a safe indication that it belongs to a spammer. Do note that the rating is logarithmic. A value of 50 means 1,000 spam messages and a value of 75 means one million spam messages. Do not set it to values over 50, as you will most likely never block any spammer at all."
ATOOLS_LBL_WAF_OPT_HTTPBLMAXAGE_TIP="Project Honeypot reports when was the last time this IP was caught sending spam messages. The older this is (the higher the age is), the less likely is that this IP is still used by a spammer. You can chose here what will be the maximum reported age that will be blocked. The default value of 30 means that IPs which have submitted a spam message in the last 30 days will be blocked."
ATOOLS_LBL_WAF_OPT_HTTPBLBLOCKSUSPICIOUS_TIP="Sometimes Project Honeypot is not sure if an IP belongs to a spammer or it's a hapless chap who clicked on the wrong link. In this case the IP is marked as "_QQ_"suspicious"_QQ_". The default behaviour is to not block these IPs. However, if you are receiving a lot of spam it's a good idea to enable this feature and block even "_QQ_"suspicious"_QQ_" IPs. Ultimately, some unfortunate users will be inadvertently blocked, so use this option with caution!"
ATOOLS_LBL_WAF_LBL_NEVERBLOCKIPS_TIP="Enter a comma-separated list of IPs which should never be automatically blocked. For example, such a list can be <em>127.0.0.1, 123.124.125.126</em> Moreover you can use IP ranges (e.g. <em>127.0.0.1-127.0.0.10</em>), implied IP range notation (<em>127.0.0.</em> for the entire 127.0.0.1 to 127.0.0.255 block) and CIDR block notation (e.g. <em>127.0.0.0/8</em>) on top of plain old IP addresses."
ATOOLS_LBL_WAF_OPT_WHITELIST_DOMAINS_TIP="If the IP address of the visitor who raised a security exception resolves to a domain name ending in what you enter here they will not be blocked. Effectively, these domain names have a free pass on your site. Please note that a long list will cause a big performance impact. Enter a comma separated list of the domain names you want to whitelist. The default value is .googlebot.com,.search.msn.com which whitelists the search engine indexers Google Bot (used by Google Search) and MSN Bot (used by Bing)."
ATOOLS_LBL_WAF_LBL_TSRENABLE_TIP="When set to yes, the IP address of repeat offenders will be automatically banned based on the rest of the settings"
ATOOLS_LBL_WAF_LBL_EMAILAFTERIPAUTOBAN_TIP="Admin Tools can optionally send you an email when an IP is automatically banned, to the email address entered in this field. Leave this field empty (default) to disable this feature."
ATOOLS_LBL_WAF_LBL_TSRSTRIKES_TIP="Chose how many attacks have to happen within how much time. For example, if you set it to 3 attacks in 1 hour, Admin Tools will ban a IP address from which at least 3 attacks have been blocked within the last hour."
ATOOLS_LBL_WAF_LBL_TSRBANNUM_TIP="How long the block will last. For example, setting it to 1 day will block all access from this IP address for a whole day."
ATOOLS_LBL_WAF_LBL_PERMABAN_TIP="If an IP triggers this many auto-bans it will be permanently banned (added to the IP blacklist) if they are about to be auto-banned again. Make sure that you turn on the IP blacklisting by setting <em>Disallow site access to IPs in Blacklist</em> to Yes, otherwise the permanent blacklisting will have no effect."
ATOOLS_LBL_WAF_LBL_PERMABANNUM_TIP="When the previous option is enabled, after how many auto-bans an IP will be permanently banned (added to the IP blacklist)."
ATOOLS_LBL_WAF_LBL_SPAMMERMESSAGE_TIP="Allows you to show a specific message to blocked IP addresses. You may want to explain to the user that his IP was blocked because suspicious activity was detected as originating from his IP address. You can use the special text [IP] in all capital letters, without spaces between the brackets and IP, to display the user's IP in the message. This may be useful if someone gets accidentally blocked and asks you to help them."
ATOOLS_LBL_WAF_OPT_SAVEUSERSIGNUPIP_TIP="When enabled, the IP new users signed up from will be stored as User Notes. Users created through the back-end will not have their IP saved as a User Note because it makes no sense to do so (it's an administrator registering the user account on their behalf). Third party components creating new user accounts may also not trigger the plugin event."
ATOOLS_LBL_WAF_OPT_LOGBREACHES_TIP="It is suggested to keep this option enabled. When enabled, all potential security breaches —blocked by Admin Tools— will be logged in the database and made available under the Security Exceptions Log tool."
ATOOLS_LBL_WAF_OPT_SHOWPWONLOGINFAILURE_TIP="Should the incorrect password be included in the mail you receive when someone triggers a failed login? This only applies when <em>Email this address on failed administrator login</em> is enabled."
ATOOLS_LBL_WAF_OPT_REASONS_NOLOG_TIP="Security exceptions caused by these blocking reasons will not be logged. As a result, IPs triggering this exception repeatedly will not be automatically banned from your site. Moreover, as there is no log, it will be impossible to tell why someone is being blocked from accessing your site when they trigger one of those reasons."
ATOOLS_LBL_WAF_OPT_REASONS_NOEMAIL_TIP="Security exceptions caused by these blocking reasons will not result in an email being sent to the email address specified in <em>Email this address on security exceptions</em>"
ATOOLS_LBL_WAF_OPT_USE403VIEW_TIP="By default, the Security Exceptions Message will be shown using Joomla!'s standard error message page. When this option is enabled, however, Admin Tools will use a customisable HTML template. The default HTML template file is located in the components/com_admintools/views/blocks/tmpl/default.php file. DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE DIRECTLY! Read the documentation for the proper method to create a template override."
