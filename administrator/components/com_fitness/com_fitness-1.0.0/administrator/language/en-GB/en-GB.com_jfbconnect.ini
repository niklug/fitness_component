COM_JFBCONNECT_OPENGRAPH_OVERVIEW_DESCRIPTION="<h2>What is Open Graph?</h2><p>Facebook's Open Graph can be broken down into 'objects' and 'actions'. An 'object' is any page on your site. An 'action' is something a user can do to that 'object'.</p><p>The example to the right shows how both affect a Facebook feed post for a user. The 'object' is a Joomla article on the site. The 'action' is that the user read that article. Before Open Graph Actions, the only things a user could do were 'Like' or 'Comment'. With JFBConnect, you can create your own custom actions for your page (read, vote, upload, cook, ran, etc).</p><h3>Objects:</h3><p>Open Graph Tags are used to describe your pages/objects to Facebook. The title, description and image (as well as other possible values) you set for each page will be used in Feed posts, letting you control how your page is seen on Facebook.</p><p>With JFBConnect, you can can set the Open Graph Tags that describe your 'objects'/pages by either:<ul><li><b>Enabling an Open Graph plugin for your extension</b><ul><li>For most extensions, this will automatically setup good Open Graph tags for each page of that extension</li><li>For more flexibility, create an 'Object' type (above) and set the tags specific to that object. For instance, you can configure the automatically generated tags for an article category.</li></ul></li><li>Adding the Open Graph tags manually on each page by adding the following tags. This overrides any automatic tags for complete control:<ul><li>{SCOpenGraph title=Title for the Page}</li><li>{SCOpenGraph description=Description for the page to show in Facebook}</li><li>{SCOpenGraph image=http://yoursite.com/link-to-image.jpg}</li></ul></li><li>Let JFBConnect automatically use your meta title and description tags for the Open Graph title and description.</li></ul></p><h3>Actions:</h3><p>Once Objects are setup, you can configure 'Actions' that can happen to those pages. Examples include reading or voting for a Joomla, K2, or EasyBlog post; uploading an image to a gallery in JomSocial; or writing a review in jReviews.</p>"
