PLG_AKEEBASUBS_IPROPERTY_USAGENOTE="Automatically adds users as agents to Intellectual Property by The Thinkery LLC. In terms of Intellectual Property lingo, each new subscriber gets a Company created for him and becomes a Super Agent for that Company. He can then add more Agents if he so wishes. The Company created for the subscriber will have the limits set up above. If the subscriber already has a Company under his user account, the limits of the Company will be updated with the MAXIMUM value specified among all subscriptions. When the subscription expires, the Company parameters are modified and/or the user is removed from being a Super Agent for the Company."
